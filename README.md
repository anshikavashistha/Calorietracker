# Calorietracker
This is a REST API for tracking calories. It allows users to create an account, log in, and manage their calorie entries. The API supports authentication, implements three roles with different permission levels, and connects to a calories API provider to fetch calorie information if not provided by the user. It also includes user settings for the expected number of calories per day, and calculates a boolean field indicating if the total for the day is below the expected calories. The API returns data in JSON format and provides filtering capabilities and pagination for list endpoints
